# if want to do sentiment analysis on chinese
# workaround is translate to English with TextBlob
# and analyze it with TextBlob or NLTK.vader

# Heavily depends on the context to know whether it is positive or negative sentiment
# 1. Polarity: if the speaker express a positive or negative opinion
# 2. Subjectivity: the thing that is being talked about

# What did you like about the event?
# What did you dislike about the event?

# Answer of these can change the sentiment
# Everything of it
# Absolutely nothing!

#              "VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY.",  # emphasis for ALLCAPS handled
#              "VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY!!!", # combination of signals - VADER appropriately adjusts intensity
#              "VADER is VERY SMART, uber handsome, and FRIGGIN FUNNY!!!", # booster words & punctuation make this close to ceiling for score
#              "VADER is not smart, handsome, nor funny.",  # negation sentence example
